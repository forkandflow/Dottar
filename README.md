# 🔐 Dottar - A Secure Git-Inspired Version Control System

Dottar is a lightweight, open-source version control system (VCS) built with Python. Inspired by Git, Dottar adds **security-first features** like encrypted commits, password-protected restore, and simplified file history management — all via an easy-to-use CLI.

> 🔧 Ideal for solo developers, students, and educational OS projects who want Git-like functionality with more privacy control.
> Rather than a normal git software we are making something that is truly different and unqiue with advance features.
